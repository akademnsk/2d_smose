\begin{abstract}
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like MoS$_2$ or WS$_2$ together with graphene and \textcolor{red}{its derivatives are the most perspective and widely investigated 2D structures (Захар замени это более конкретной фразой)}.
TMDs with top and bottom layers consisting of sulphur and selenium atoms, respectively, were produced experimentally and were called Janus structures.
In the present work, we perform the theoretical search of the new Janus structures with compositions SMoSe and SVSe and reveal new crystal structures.
Three of the found structures, called SMoSe-airss1 and SVSe-T-hor are especially perspective for experimental synthesis and practical application.
These structures show dynamic stability and have enthalpies lower than enthalpy of experimentally synthesised although metastable 1T structure.
For  SVSe composition, enthalpy of airss-1 structure is 0.22 ev/f.u lower than that of 1T structure and 0.08  ev/f.u higher than that of  1H structure.
Presence of the vanadium atoms having magnetic moment in the crystal structure implies the possible application of these structues as \textcolor{red}{magnetic materials (Захар, уточни здесь])}.
Also we revel several dynamically stable crystal structures with unique crystal chemical features, such as formation of quadruble Mo--Mo bond or covalent S--S or Se--Se bonds.
Nothing similar have not been earlier observed for TMDs.
Bsed on crystal chemical analysis we show the tendency of Mo-bearing TMDs to the foramtion of strong Mo-Mo bonds forming chains or isolated  dimeres of molybdenum atoms.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent a wide family of materials consisting of transition metal (TM) of group IV, V or VI surrounded by chalcogen atoms (Ch) of S, Se or Te. 
TMDs crystallize in four main structural types, CdI$_2$, MoS$_2$ and FeS$_2$-pyrite, and less frequently in FeS$_2$-marcasite structural type \cite{wells1986_book} [A.F. Wells. Structural Inorganic Chemistry, 1986]

The first two structural types are characterized by the layered structures with Ch-TM-Ch sandwiches bonded with each other by the weak Van-der-Waals bonds and, therefore, the crystals can be exfoliated into individual stable layers \cite{zhang2020intercalation}. These quasi-2D sandwiches attract considerable attention due to their wide range of properties \cite{li2017graphene, SHI20181, xi2016ising, hu2019recent, pi2019recent}. 
Particularly the TMDCs can act as semiconductors \cite{nayeri2018transport}, metals \cite{zhao20212d}, semimetals \cite{xu2020high, zhao2020observation} or superconductors \cite{wang2020nodeless,hsu2017topological} which make family of TMDs suitable for a lot of applications. 

At ambient conditions MX$_2$ (M=Mo,W, X=S,Se) structures crystallize in the archetype molybdenite structure (MoS$_2$) which consists of close-packed layers of chalcogen atoms placed exactly one under/above another and TM atoms occupy one half of the  trigonal prismatic cavities located between the layers of chalcogen atoms. 
In the most stable polytype of molybdenite (MoS$_2$) structure M--X--M multiplet layers are arranged similarly to the close-packed layers of {\it hcp} structure -- close-packed structure with periodicity of stacking through each two layers, the structure (Figure \ref{1H1T}a).
Due to hexagonal symmetry this structure of TMD according to Ramsdell notation can be denoted as 2H.
In the present work, we do not consider the stacking sequence of M--X--M sandwich and will denote all structures as 1H.
Such a sandwich, consisting of three layers, in crystllchemical community usually termed as {\it multiplet layer}.
Hoewere in 2D community the term {\it monolayer}, emphasising absence of van-der-waals bonds wihtin the layer, is more accepted and we will follow the last tradition. 

If one layer of chalcogen atoms in M--X--M monolayer is shifted, the coordination polyhedron of metal atoms is changed from trigonal prism to the octahedron (Figure \ref{1H1T}b).
This is CdI$_2$ structural type. 
The monolayer of such a structure has trigonal symmetry and can be designated as 1T \cite{huang2020recent}. 
The deformed 1T structure with chains of Mo atoms connected by the shorted bonds is denoted as 1T' \cite{huang2020recent}.
Depending on the exact chemical composition of the TMD monolayer, 1H or 1T phase is thermodynamically stable \cite{ataca2012stable}. 
For the disulphides, diselenides, and ditellurides of Mo or W, the  1T-phase is less energetically favorable than 1H-phase with the same chemical composition. 
However 1T structure can be obtained by means of intercalation \cite{kan2014structures, wang2014atomic}, deformation \cite{duerloo2014structural} or surface functionalization \cite{tang2015stabilization, voiry2015covalent}. 
In contrast to Mo, W and most of the other TMs, dichalcogenides of vanadium are not known \cite{murphy1977preparation, le1979elaboration}. 
Only Se$_2$V$1.005$ with additional vanadium atoms located in the centers of empty trigonal prismatic cavities is known in the form of 2H structure \cite{rigoult1982}.

Recently a new subclass of TMDs where top and bottom layers are formed by different chalcogen atoms, were produced and attracts significant interest \cite{lu2017, zhang2017janus}. 
Such a structures were called called Janus structures.
The opportunity to change the top layer of atoms opens an additional degree of freedom to manipulate the properties of TMDs. 
Janus TMDs have structural symmetry breaking \cite{li2017electronic, van2020first} resulting in Rashba spin splitting \cite{hu2018intrinsic} and transverse dipole moment leading to large piezoelectricity \cite{dong2017large, li2018recent}. 
The Janus structures of TMDs have a lot of potential applications, among which water-splitting \cite{xia2018universality, ma2018janus} or hydrogen evolution reaction \cite{er2018prediction, zhou2019janus}. 
Theoretical investigations show that, as in the case of pristine monolayers, Janus TMDs with different chemical compositions can be thermodynamically stable in the 1H and 1T structures desrcibed above.
Meanwhile, the different composition of the top and bottom layers assume the possibility for the stabilization of the new structures, substantially different from 1H or 1T.

This assumption was the motivation for us to perform the search for the new Janus TMDs structure using unbiased methods of crystal structure prediction, which have not been performed jet.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Crystal structure prediction}
%%%%%%%%%


The search for the lowest-enthalpy monolayer structures of SMoSe and SVSe compositions was performed using evolutionary algorithms implemented in the USPEX program package \cite{uspex1,uspex2,uspex3} and the random sampling method implemented in the AIRSS software \cite{airss1,airss2}.

The crystal structure search within USPEX was performed in fixed composition mode with 2--6 formula units per unit cell.
The number of structures in the first generation of the calculations was equal to 180.
Half of the structures with the lowest enthalpy were selected after the optimization and then used to produce the next generation.
A new generation was produced as follow: 50\% of all structures were generated by heredity, 10\% -- by atomic mutation, 10\% –- by lattice mutation, and 30\% –- randomly.
In average, 40--47 generations were produced and relaxed.
Using AIRSS program about 5000--6000 structures were randomly generated and optimized for compounds with 4 and 6 formula units per unit cell and structures with the lowest enthalpy were selected.

The total energies and forces were calculated by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation based on projector augmented plane-wave implementation \cite{blochl1994projector} of density functional theory (DFT) using the VASP program package \cite{vasp1,vasp2}.
Exchange correlation effects were treated in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-B\"{u}rke-Ernzerhof scheme \cite{pbe}.

In all crystal structure prediction calculations medium-quality optimization was performed using the conjugate gradient method \cite{conjugate_gradient}. 
The energy cutoff of plane waves was set to 420 eV and 700 eV for the intermediate structures and then for the most promising of them. 
The first Brillouin zone was sampled according to Monkhorst-Pack scheme \cite{monkhorst1976special} with the density of k-point being equal to 0.5 \AA$^{-1}$ and 0.2 \AA$^{-1}$, respectively. 
% проверить 2pi

To study a dynamic stability of predicted structures phonon dispersion spectra were calculated within the PHONOPY code \cite{phonopy}. 
We used VESTA program for crystal structures visualization and figures preparation \cite{momma2011vesta}.
Instruments of Bilbao Crystallographic server have been used for the structures symmetrisation \cite{bilbao}.


%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Topological search}
%%%%%%%%

Within topologocal search, original crystal-structural information was selected from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD, release 2020/2) \cite{icsd_1} and Cambridge Structural Database (CSD, release 2021) \cite{icsd_2}.
In this case, the procedures of screening of structural-graphic databases of compounds by the methods of the combined geometric-topological analysis with ToposPro (http://topospro.com) package have been used \cite{topos_1}. 

We use bold three-letter symbols of the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource nomenclature (for the three-letter nomenclature of polyhedral and nets see Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource, http://rcsr.anu.edu.au/, and \cite{rcsr}) or ToposPro NDk-n symbols \cite{rcsr_2}) to designate the topological types of the underlying nets. 
The topology of an underlying net is determined in an automated mode by comparison of a set of topological indices of the net with those for the reference nets from the ToposPro TTD collection \cite{TTD}.

For the topological analysis we have used only fully solved crystal structures without errors in the determination of interatomic bonds or chemical composition,
The nets of interatomic bonds were determined by the Domains methods with the program AutoCN \cite{blatov2016_rods}. 
Only strong interatomic bonds  with solid angles of the faces of Voronoi-Dirihle polyhedron $\Omega \geq 5 $ of the whole 4$\pi$ solid angle were considered.
Structures with the great values of unit cell parameters were excluded from the consideration.
For instance, we did not consider polytypes of ZnS with cell parameters more than 50 \AA.

Earlier the numerous structural relations between unhydrous simple salts and even more simple binary inorganic compounds have been shown \cite{blatov2011_salts, medrish2020_zintl}. 
Due to this well-known structural phenomena, we analyse topology not only for the complete  representation, but all so the topology of the underlying net.
In the complete representation, the net corresponds to the interatomic bonds of all strong bonds, while the underlying net is determined between metalls and centers of ligands.

Due to the short interatomic bonds, the topologies were not determined for the crystal structures airss1, fxt, and  test3.

\subsection*{Earlier known MX$_2$ structures and their enthalpies}

Although 1H and 1T structures are characterized by the different coordination polyhedra, they are similar in the manner of their interconnection.
The H structure consists of trigonal prisms [MX$_6$], and 1T structure –- of the [MX6] octahedra, where X is chalcogen atom of sulphur or selenium (Figure\ref{1H1T}).
Each trigonal prism share all three vertical edges with the neighbouring prisms and does not share any faces (Figure \ref{1H1T}a).
As the result, each vertex and each vertical edge of the trigonal prism is common for three prisms (Figure \ref{1H1T}a).
Similarly in 1T structure, each octahedron share all edges inclined to the plane of sulphur atoms with neighbouring octahedra, and each vertex is common for three octahedra (Figure \ref{1H1T}b).
Bond valence of Mo--S bond is nearly equal to +4/6 and there are necessary three such a bonds to compensate negative charge of S$^{2-}$.
Interconnection through the faces gives shorter bonds between high-charged M$^{4+}$ ions, increasing the energy of Couloumb interaction, and making the structure less favourable \cite{pauling1929}.
As we will shown below the interconnection through the faces is also realised for predicted structures, but they are less favourable than 1H or 1T structure.

According to the performed calculations, 1H structure is the most favourable for SMoSe composition, but it is less favourable than 1T and 1T' for SVSe composition.
The difference of enthalpies $H(1H)-H(1T)$ is equal to -0.73 ev/f.u. for SMoSe and 0.09 for SVSe (Table \ref{t:enthalpy}).
For SVSe composition the most favourable phase is 1T', which enthalpy is 0.11 ev/f.u lower than the enthalpy of 1T (Table \ref{t:enthalpy}). 

The recently found fes and fxt structures are also characterised by the trigonal prismatic coordination.
However, in these structure prisms are connected not only through edges but also through the faces (Figure \ref{fes_fxt}).
In accordance with above consideration, the enthalpies of fxt and fes structures are higher than that of 1H structure, although lower than that of 1T structures.
As well as in 1H and 1T structures, in fxt and fes structures,  each chalcogen atoms is connected to three atoms of transition metal, providing the local charge balance (Figure \ref{fes_fxt}).
As we will show below, this is also not the obligatory requirement and some of the revealed structures are not charactersied by the local charge balance.
According to our calculations, fes and fxt structures are chacterised by the close values of enthalpies.
For both SMoSe and SVSe, fes is more energetically favourable than fxt, with enthalpies difference equal to 0.01 ev/f.u. for SMoSe and 0.06 ev/f.u. for SVSe (Table \ref{t:enthalpy}).
In turn, enthalpy of SMoSe-fes structure is 0.79 eV/f.u. higher than enthalpy of the 1H structure.
Enthalpy of SVSe-fex is 0.64 higher than that of 1T'.
According to our calculations, the fxt and fes structures in the Janus form are less favourable than 1T (Table \ref{t:enthalpy}).

1H and 1T structures provide the most uniform distribution of the chalсogen and transition metall atoms.
Nets of  both transition metall and chalcogen atoms consist of the geometrically equal triangular rings.
Edge-sharing interconnection of trigonal prisms realised in fxt and fes structures inevitably results in the appearance of the cavities greater in volume than the cavities of 1H and 1T structures. 
In fes structure the cavities have the form of the slightly compressed cube (Figure \ref{fes_fxt}a).
The volume of these cavities is almost two times greater than the volume of the cavities in 1H structure (38.8 \AA$^3$ against 17.7 \AA$^3$).
In case of fxt structure, the volume of hexagonal cavities (Figure \ref{fes_fxt}b is almost 8 times larger than that in 1H structure (137.8 \AA\ against 17.7 \AA$^3$).

In contrast to trigonal prisms, the face-sharing of the octahedra seems to be problematic for quasi 2D structure, as it is results in the deviation from the flat arrangement.
However, as it will be shown below, the dynamically stable quasi-2D structure characterising by the face sharing octahedra was also revealed.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		\subsection{New Janus TMD structures}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Table \ref{t:enthalpy} shows the values of enthalpies for the most energetically favorable structures among revealed with USPEX and AIRSS.
 Figures \ref{phon_smose} and  \ref{phon_svse} show their phonon spectra. 
 
Among the found structures, two structures, T-hor and airss-1, are most promising.
In addition to dynamic stability, the enthalpies of formation of SMoSe-airss1 and SVSe-T-hor structures are lower than that of experimentally synthesised 1T phase.
This assumes the possibility for their experimental synthesis with nearly the same probability.

For SMoSe composition, crystal structures H-hor, airss-3, test-1 and test-3 are also dynamically stable, but energetically leass favourable thant 1H or 1T structures (Figure \ref{phon_smose}, Table \ref{t:enthalpy}).
For SVSe composition, airss-1 and airss-3 are dynamically stable (Figure \ref{phon_svse}).
Crystal structure test-2 is vice versa dynamically unstable (Figures \ref{phon_smose} and \ref{phon_svse}) but energetically favourable. 

Below we describe the revealed crystal structure, beginning from the most energetically favourable ones.

All listed structures are characterised by the triclinic or monocliniс symmetry.
In accordance with Ramsdell notation, we will designate structure of triclinic symmetry as 1A, and structures of monoclinic symmetry as 1M.
To differentiate structures of the same symmetry we will use single quotes, for instance {\it 1A, 1A', and 1A''} crystall structures of triclinic symmetry, which are charactersied by the sufficiently different atomic arrangements.

\subsubsection{Structures revealed with {\it unbiased} algorithms}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{SVSe-1M structure}

The structure with monoclinic symmetry was predicted using USPEX for SVSe and was called SVSe-1M (T-hor). 
For SVSe composition it is more  energeticaly favourable than both 1H and 1T structure, although it is less favourable than 1T' (Figure \ref{t:enthalpy}).
Calculation of phonon dispersion curves have shown dynamic stability of SVSe-1M (Figure \ref{phon_svse}) and instability of SMoSe-1M (Figure \ref{phon_smose}) structures.


T-hor structure is characterised by the same octahedral coordination polyhedron as 1T structure.
The difference is in the arrangement of the coordination [TMSSe$_3$] octahedra.
As it was mentioned, in 1T structure octahedra share only common edges, while in T-hor both edges and faces.
Both structures can be described within modular approach.
In this case, the module is the double row of octahedra connected through the common edges.
In Figure \ref{T_hor_T} one of such a double rows is the row consisting of the rows \# 2 and \# 3.
In T-hor structure, the adjacent double layers are attached through the common faces  of the octahedra (the face I(II)III on the Figure \ref{T_hor_T}).
In 1T structure the the intercinnection is edge-sharing (the edge II'III' in Figure \ref{T_hor_T}). 
The interconnection of the adjacent double layers in T-hor and 1T structure is illustrated in  Figure \ref{T_hor_slabs}.
The joining of the double layers through the common face is identical to the mirror reflection of the initial double layer in the plane going through this face.
Thus T-hor structure can be obdtained from 1T one by means of twinning operation.


The described rearrangement of coordination octahedra results in the sufficient rearrangement of V atoms, with the appearance of the zig-zag chains of V atoms connected by the shorter bonds (Figure \ref{T_hor_V}) and undulation of the whole structure (Figures \ref{T_hor_hcb}).
The nets of chalcogen atoms are not affected so much and in T-hor structure it is topologically the same as that in 1T structure, although the difference of geometrical parameters is sufficient.
The angles between S--S bonds in SVSe-T-hor structure vary in the range 91.38-139.8\textdegree, while in SVSe-1T structure all the angles are equal to 120\textdegree (Figure \ref{T_hor_ch}).
The S--S bond lengths in T-hor are in the range 3.45--3.87\AA, while in 1T all they are equal to 3.41 \AA (Figure \ref{T_hor_ch}).

T-hor structure is characterised by the uniqe topology– 3,3,5,8-coordinated net if short V--V bonds are considered and 3,3,5,6-coordinated net if V--V bonds are not considered.
We have not found analogues of these nets in ICSD.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{SMoSe-1M' (H-hor) structure}
Another structure with monoclinic symmetry sufficiently different from 1M structure was found using USPEX package for SMoSe composition.
This structure was named SMoSe-1M' (Table \ref{t:str}).
1M' structure is dynamically stable for SMoSe (Figure \ref{phon_smose}) composition and unstable for SVSe composition (Figure \ref{phon_svse}).


Enthalpy of SMoSe-1M' is higher than the enthalpy of 1T structure on 0.05 eV/f.u
It is as well higher than that of aforementioned 1M on 0.05 eV/f.u.

1M' structure is different from other structues in that it is characterised by the square net of chalcogen atoms.
The rings of the net are almost right squares (Figure \ref{H-hor}).
The bottom (selenium) layer is shifted relatively the top (sulphur) one (Figure \ref{H-hor}).
Transition metall atoms disposed in such a way to have trigonal prismatic coordination.
Similarly as it is in 1H, in 1M' structure trigonal prisms share only common edges, but not common faces.
Molybdenum atoms are connected by the bonds of 3.08--3.22 \AA\ lengths in quasi-1D chains.
The chains are connected by the sufficiently weaker bonds of 4.08 \AA\ length (Figure \ref{H-hor_Mo}).

	\caption{Chains of molybdenum atoms in SMoSe-1M' crystal structure.}
	\label{H-hor_Mo}
\end{figure} 


\paragraph{SVSe-1A and SMoSe-1A' structures}
The structure with triclinic symmetry called 1A, was revealed with AIRSS package for SVSe compositions.
Despite sufficeint structural similarity between optimised 1A structure for SMoSe and SVSe compositions there apparent crystallographic difference between them, similar to that observed for 1T and 1T' structure.
Based on this we will designate them as SVSe-1A and SMoSe-1A'.
Both structures are dynamically stable.

For SMoSe-1A, the enthlpy ratio is the following: 1T > 1A > 1T' > 1H.
The enthalpy of 1A structure in this case lie inbetween values of enthalpies of 1T and 1T' structures, being more favourable than 1T on nearly 0.1 eV/f.u.
For SVSe-1A' -- 1T' < 1T < 1H < 1A and 1A' structure is less favourable than 1H on nearly the same value.


The structures 1A and 1A' can be better described based on the net of transition metall atoms, which forms the well known Kagome lattice\cite{zhang2021_kagome}, observed for instance in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ \cite{ortiz2021} and WO3 \cite{gerand1979} compounds.
In SMoSe-1A and SVSe-1A', Kagome lattices are not of ideal hexagonal symmetry, there is dispersion in bond lenghts and deviation of bond angles from ideal values of 120\textdegree.
In SVSe-1A, the bond lengths vary in the range 3.07--3.49 \AA\ and bonds between the angles – in the rage 115-122.9\textdegree (Figure \ref{airss1_tm}).
In SMoSe-1A', the bond lengths are in the wide range of 2.78--3.79 \AA, and bond angles are in the range 113.9--125.7 \textdegree.
SMoSe-1A' is different from SVSe-1Ain that it is charactersied by the presence of trinagular clusters of transition metall atoms with sufficiently shorter bond lengths.
The bond leghts within clusters are equal to 2.78--2.81 \AA, while other Mo--Mo bonds are on 0.5--1 \AA longer (Figure \ref{airss1_tm}).
In SMoSe-1T' structure, the zig-zag chains of Mo atoms are connected by the bond of 2.79 \AA, which is of the samle length as short bonds in 1A' structure.
As it will be shown below, the formation of clusters and chains was observed for many structures with molybdenum.

To evaluate the probability for the synhtesis of airss1 structure on the substrate of other compound with similar kagome lattice of vandium or molybdenum we have performed the automated topological search through ICSD.
As the result 17 structures containing kagome lattice of vanadium atoms have been found, among which are Ta$_2$V$_3$Si \cite{Ta2V3Si}, CaV$_3$Sb$_4$ \cite{ CaV3Sb4}, KV$_3$Sb$_5$ \cite{KV3Sb5}, and CoVZr \cite{ZrVCO}.
The structures with Kagome-lattice of molybdenum atoms have not been revealed.
The lengths of V--V bonds in the revealed structures vary in the range 2.43--2.81 \AA  crystal structures.
The pure vanadium and molybdenum are characterised by the similar bond lengths, which are equal to 2.62 \AA\ \cite{MoV} and 2.72 \AA\ \cite{MoV}, respectively.
This is close to the lengths of bonds in the mentioned triangular clusters of Mo atoms and sufficiently higher than the lengths of V--V bonds in kagome net of SVSe-1A.
Thus, based on the structres presented in ICSD it is problematic to suggest the proper substrate for the synthesis of 1A or 1A' structures.


The net of sulphur atoms in airss1 structure is different from that in 1T or 1H structures (Figure \ref{airss1_s}).
However both nets can be transformed into each other by the shift shown in the Figure \ref{airss1_s} and subsequent deformations.
Differences of bond angles and bons lengths in 1A and 1A' structures do not exceed 0.1 \AA\ and 1\textdegree.
Net of sulphur atom is not planar, the aplanarity are nearly equal to $\pm$10\textdegree.

In 1A and 1A' structures, each transition metall atom is cooridnated by  chalcogen atoms arranged in highly deformed tetragonal pyramids.
The composition of such a pyramids are VS$_3$Se$_2$ or VS$_2$Se$_3$ (MoS$_3$Se$_2$ or MoS$_2$Se$_3$, respectively).
The bond distances between transtion metall and chalcogen atoms varies in the range 2.26--2.58 \AA\ for SVSe-1A and in the range 2.29--2.63 \AA for SMoSe-1A'.
The pyramids are connected through the common edges in triangular clusters, corresponding to the triangular rings of the mentioned Kagome lattice (Figure \ref{airss1_poly}).
Between clusters there are the big holes -- the centers of hexagonals rings of kagome lattice \ref{airss1_poly}).

\paragraph{SVSe-1A'' and SMoSe-1A''' structures}
Crystal structure called airss3 were predicted using AIRSS code for SVSe composition.
This structure is the good illustration for the different effects of vanadium and molybdenum on the crystal structure of dichalcogenides.
Structures in both compositions (SMoSe and SVSe) are dynamically stable.
For SVSe composition airss3 structure is more favourable than fes and fxt structures on nearly 0.4 eV/f.u., while for SMoSe is less favourable on the same value of energy.

Optimisation drastically changes initial airss-3 crystal structure.
It can be clearly seen in side viwew, that in V-bearing crystal structure atoms of transition metall are nearly in the same plane as sulphur and selenium while for Mo-bearing structure they are between the leayers of sulphur and selenium.

The net of chalcogen are also sufficiently different.
For SVSe the topology of the net corresponds to the hexagonal net, while for SMoSe composition – for triangular net, if the weak contacs are consdered.
The new crystallchemical feature, found fo SVSe composition, is the presence of S--S and Se--Se dimers with the bond length of 2.09 \AA\ and 2.37 \AA\, respectively/
This bond lenghts corresponds to the lengths of the bond in the crystals tructures of elemental sulphur and selenium.
Sucher a clusters were not observed in crystal structures of dichalcogenides before.
Other S--S and Se--Se bonds sufficiently longer, varying in the range 3.17--3.73 \AA.
In the nets of chclcogen atoms in SMoSe composition, there are no clusters and S--S bond lengths vary in the range 3.24-3.79 \AA\ with the weak contacts of 4.58--4.64 \AA\ length.

The net of transition metall are also drastically different which can be seen from the figures ( a  b).
Similarly to the described above for the SMoSe-airss1 crystl structure, the net of Mo-bearing airss3 crystal structure is characterised by the presence of Mo--Mo dimers with the bond leghts of 2.85 \AA, while other bonds vary in the range 3.04--3.74 \AA.
There is no such a short bonds in SVSe-airss-3 crystal sructure, and the bond smoothly vary in the range 3.32--3.79 \AA.

!!!Тут нам нужно переименовать airss3-SMoSe, т.к. это другая структура.


Mo atoms in SMoSe-airss3 structure are four- and five-coordinated by chaclcogen atoms, with coordination polyhedra of the deformed tetrahedron and trigonal bipyramid (Figure \ref{airss3_poly}b).
In structure SVSe-airss3 atoms of transition metall are five and six-coordinated (Figure \ref{airss3_poly}a).
Coordination polyhedra are  deformed tetragonal pyramid and trigonal prism, respectively.
Two of six atoms in six-coordinated environment are the dimers of sulphur or slenium (Figure \ref{airss3_poly}a).
In structure of SMoSe infinite chain of cooridnation polyhedra, while in crystal structure of SVSe infinite quadruple chain of cooridnation poluhedra can be distinguished (Figure \ref{airss3_poly}).
Within the chain coordination polyhedra are connected through common edges.
The adjacent chains in SVSe structure are also connected through the common edges, while in SMoSe structure – through the common edges.

\subsubsection{Structures produced manually based on 1H structure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we consider crystal structures produced manually based on the 1H structure by the procedure which can be also used for the generation of the fxt and fes structures.
Similarly to fxt and fes these stracters can be considered as the possible grain boundaries.
As it will be shown, below the enthalpies of obtained strucrures are higher then enthalpies of fxt and fes.
However, we add their decription hear together with the description of fxt and fes, to illustrate the formation of molybdenum dimers in SMoSe structures.
Also we would like to descibe the procedure of structure generation, which can be also applied for the generation of the other structures.

To produce new structures with trigonal prismatic coordination of TM atoms, we present the structures as different fillings of the hexagonal net of sulphur atoms (Figure \ref{H-based}).
1H structure presents the most symmetric chess-board-like filling (Figure \ref{H-based}a).
The fes structure can be also considered as the chess-board filling, but with doubled triangular cells, having the form of rhombuses (Figure \ref{H-based}b).
After optimisation, these rhombuses trasform into the right squares (Figure \ref{H-based}b).
In fxt structure, the empty rings are of two types.
The first are primitive (non-centered) triangles, and the second are face-centered hexagons consisting six triangular rings connected through the faces (Figure \ref{H-based}c).
The optimisation does not sufficiently change the forms of the empty rings, slightly deforming hexagons (Figure \ref{H-based}c).
In SMoSe and SVSe compositions, both fxt and fes are energetically less favourable than predicted H-hor, T-hor and airrs-1.
In one case, for H-hor and fxt structures of SMoSe composition, enthalpies can be considered as equal within the error of the method.

Three new structures were produced in the similar way as it has been done for fxt and fes.
We named these structures abstractly test1, test2, and test3.
These structures are not dynamically stable for SVSe composition (Figure \ref{phon_svse}), and for SMoSe composition test1 and test3 are stable, while test2 are not (Figure \ref{phon_smose}).
For SMoSe composition enthalpis of dynamically stable test1 and and test3 structures are higher than that of  fes and fxt on nearly 0.1 eV/fu.

We failed to produce new structures obeying the local charge balance, i.e. the structures in which each vertex of the trigonal prism is common for three prisms, as it is in 1H, fxt and fes.
In the structure test1, sulphur atoms are common for two or four trigonal prisms, in test2 and test3 – for two or three, or fourtrigonal prisms (Figure \ref{H-based}).
Test3 structure is different from the other structures in that it is characterised by the presence of trigonal prisms with two common faces, while in all other structures prisms has no more than one common face.
As it will be shown below this is important for the formation of Mo--Mo dimers.
Optimisation of test3 structure sufficiently affect the arrangement of sulphur atoms.
In the final structure the net of sulphur atoms is not more the hexagonal one (Figure \ref{H-based}f).
Mo atoms in test3 structure are not only in trigonal prismatic but also in quadratic coordination (Figure \ref{H-based}f).
Despite this drastic structural changes at optimisation stage, test3 structure is dynamically stable for SMoSe composition (Figure \ref{phon_smose}).

Presense of common edges and faces of [MoO$_6$] trigonal prisms in fxt, fes, test1, test2, and test3 structures results in shorter Mo--Mo distances in comparison with 1H structure, where prisms have only common edges.
In 1H structure, Mo atoms form regular hexagonal net with all Mo--Mo bonds being equal to 3.25 \AA.
This bond length corresond to the edge sharing disposition of trigonal prisms.
In fxt, fes, and test1 structure Mo--Mo distances for edge sharing disposition in prisms is equal to 2.9--3.8 \AA.
For face sharing disposition, the Mo--Mo distances is sufficiently shorter.
In fxt and fes tructers they are equal to 2.9 \AA, in test1 -- to 2.75 \AA and in test2 -- to 2.62 \AA.
These distances are close to the Mo--Mo distances in the zig-zag chains of Mo atoms in 1T' structure (2.75 \AA).
This value is in turn equal to the shortest distance between Mo atoms in the {\it bcc} structure of pure Mo (2.72 \AA) \cite{MoV}.
Test3 structure is characterised by the the sufficiently shorter Mo--Mo bond.
The disantace between the neighbouring Mo atoms in dimer is equal to 2.22 \AA\.
This short bond length corresponds to the quadruple Mo--Mo bond in Mo$_2^{4+}$ dimers, found in numerous organic molecules \cite{momo}.
Similarly to orgnic molecules, in test3 structure  each molybdenum atom of Mo--Mo dimer bound to four ligand atoms that define almost right square (Figure \ref{test3_momo}).
Despite the relatively high enthalpy of test3 structure, its dynamic stability show the possibility for the formation of quadruply bonded of Mo$_2^{4+}$ dimers in 2D structures of transition metal dichalcogenides.
The possibility which was not considered earlier.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The uniquenes of the new structures}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To answer the question, whether the found structures are unique or there are similar representatives in ICSD we have performed topological search.
The obtained results have shown that all the found structures, except of H-hor, are unique and similar structures are not found in ICSD.
The same is true about the earlier known fxt and fes structures, similar structures of which have not also been found. 
The H-hor structure belong to the same kgd topological type as the T structure.
This means that one structure can be transformed into another without breaking the bonds.
However the geometrical difference of H-hor and T structures is sufficient and transformation of one structure into the other requires changing of the coordination polyhedron from trigonal prism to octahedron.

Hwever, as ICSD is specialised on the coolection of mainly 3D, experimentally determined structures, the synthesis in the form of monolayers or thin films or the predictions or the predictions of similar structures for some compositions can not be excluded.



\subsection{Possible practical application}

As it was mentioned the special manuscript will be devoted the calculations of physical properties of the predicted structures.
Here, wou would like only to speculate about the possibility of practical applications of the found structures.

The crystal field theory proceeds from the fact that the nature of ligands and their location around the central ion (symmetry of the complex) reduce the degeneracy of d-orbitals and change their energy. As all investigated structures consist of transition metal atoms surrounded by ligands (chalcogen atoms), the presence of the ligands splits the d-electrons levels depending on local symmetry. Thereby the correlation between structure and electronic properties can be interpreted in terms of crystal field theory. According to crystal field theory, in an octahedral environment (1T polymorph), the d-shell splits into a low-energy triplet (t2g) and a high-energy doublet (eg). In a trigonal prismatic geometry (1H), the low-energy triplet further splits into a doublet and a singlet [https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1583/ab0188]. The two polymorphs of MoS2 have distinct electronic properties, the 1H-MoS2 is a semiconductor and the 1T-MoS$_2$ is metallic. The fes-SMoSe despite the prismatic environment of TM atom becomes a semi-metal [10.1016/j.physe.2020.114485 , 10.1039/D1NA00112D] and fxt Mo and W based TMDs are gapless semiconductors or, alternatively, semimetals [10.1103/PhysRevB.93.035442]. The proposed structure airss-1 is characterized by a distorted trigonal bipyramidal local environment of the TM atom, which should make these structures more metallic due to degenerate d-orbitals. The squire pyramidal environment in airss-3 with the bare square facet of the pyramid can apply this structure for molecular sorption which makes materials in such structure perspective for sensoric and catalytic applications. In addition, despite the fact that the surroundings of metal atoms have a prismatic environment in the geometries fxt and fes make metal atoms available for use in chemical applications due to the steric factor.

The variation of structures dictates variation electronic properties based on different d-splitting and electron filling of d-orbitals which makes it possible to manipulate electronic properties through phase transformation.

Comment. 
fes structure denoted as S-MS2 in \cite{tang2021_smose}.
fxt structure denoted as H' in \cite{ma2016_h'}.
Similarly there is T' – deformed T-phase.
We can follow this notation, designating our phases by symmetry with addition of '.

In H-hor structure, atoms of transition metall is in trigonal prismatic coordination, similarly to 1Н structure.
The difference between 1H and H-hor structures is in that in H-hor three-folld symmetry axis of trigonal prism is parallell to the plane of the layer, while in 1H it is perpendicular.
